# House-Price-Prediction

This is my course project for the Spring 2024 Introdution to Machine Learning (CS 182) course. This study focuses on predicting house prices using various regression models. And at last the study concludes with a blended model approach that combines predictions from the best-performing models to achieve a robust final prediction.
